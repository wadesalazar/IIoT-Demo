# Items on hand



For IoT applications

* Beaglebone Black https://beagleboard.org/black. Think of this as a open source ras. pi
* TI Sensor Tag - these are little blue tooth LE dongles packed with sensors.  Great for prototyping 
* USB Bluetooth LE adapter ( https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/USBBT400/ )

These combine nicely into what a intelligent edge device might look like.  
The BBB serves as a local aggregator for the sensor tags performing operations, filters etc on incoming signals
The BBB can then pump out little bits of info or full streams 
** Max stream data density is defined by 1) bandwidth of the sensor network or 2) sensor charateristics
